# 06_SQL_in_Python
In this notebook I created a database &amp; table in Python notebook using SQLite3. Then created a table and insert a few rows of data into it. Then queried the data. I also retrieved the data into a pandas dataframe.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the creation and manipulation of a SQLite3 database within a Python notebook. The notebook covers the following tasks:
1. Creating a database and table using SQLite3.
2. Inserting rows of data into the table.
3. Querying the data from the table.
4. Retrieving the queried data into a Pandas DataFrame.

## Contents

- `SQLite.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all the code and explanations for the tasks mentioned above.

## Requirements

To run this notebook, you need the following Python libraries:
- `sqlite3`: Standard library for SQLite operations.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.

You can install the `pandas` library using pip if you don't have it already:
